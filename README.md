Which way should you go? Will you be tempted by the beauty of the scenery, or will your gut tell you to stay far away? And most importantly, do you trust the Witch?

A look at some of the beautiful scenes and less-beautiful characters in the land of the Witch:

**To run on your machine**
If not already installed, install the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Download the GoodWitch code by clicking the "Code" Button on the right side of the screen in [the GoodWitch Repository](https://github.com/mikielmcrae/GoodWitch):

Download the code as a ZIP. Once downloaded, double click the folder to unzip, and double click the first .py file entitled "adventure.py".

If Python is installed correctly on the machine, this should open the adventure.py script in IDLE. By selecting "Run" from the Menu bar in IDLE, the option to "Run Module" should appear first.

Once this is selected, you're ready to play GoodWitch!

Other modules from the game can be opened in IDLE as well for examination by simply double clicking their names in the GoodWitch folder downloaded.

Happy choosing!
